# Minimal Loading Screen template

This is a WebGL template for Unity3D. It strips out the logo, game name and fullscreen button from the template, but keeps the loading screen that shows while requesting JS files for the player.

## Usage

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/fireotters/minimal-loading-screen-template/releases/latest)
- On your Unity project, under the Assets directory, create a new directory called `WebGL Templates`.
- Inside this folder, extract all the contents in a subdirectory of `WebGL Templates` (the directory tree should look something like `Assets/WebGL Templates/Minimal Loading Screen Template`)
- Under Player Settings, a new option should now show up for usage.
